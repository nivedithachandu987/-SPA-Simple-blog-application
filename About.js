Dr Paritosh Baghel revealed, “As the name shows, viral infections are infections caused by various types of viruses. Viruses can affect any organ system of our body like the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, heart, nervous system etc. During monsoons, one common viral infection is fever. Most times, the temperature of the human body is 98.6°F or 37°C. If the temperature increases even a degree above, it is a fever. Fevers often signify that the human body is trying to fight off bacterial or viral infection.”

What are the symptoms of viral fever?
Dr Paritosh Baghel explained, “Since the monsoon follows summers, there is a sudden dip in the temperature, which results in a surge of viral infection among the general population. This viral infection generally affects the respiratory tract, including the nose, sinuses, throat, and lungs. In most cases, the infection spreads from one person to another by droplet transmission. When an infected person coughs, yawns, sneezes or even talks, they spray small particles of fluids (droplets) which contain the viruses. If an uninfected person stands close to them, the virus can enter their body via the nose or mouth, causing them to become infected. Once infected, it would take about 16 to 48 hours to turn into a full-blown infection.”

He elaborated, “Some symptoms of viral fever include chills, sweating, dehydration, headache, muscle aches and pains, a feeling of weakness and loss of appetite. Sometimes symptoms are vague and can take time to debilitate a person completely. The best way to diagnose a fever at home is to check the person’s temperature with the help of a thermometer. If fever exists, it is best that the person consults a specialist at the earliest to ascertain the diagnosis and start treatment.”
